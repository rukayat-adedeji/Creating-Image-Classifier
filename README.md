# Creating Image Classifier Project

## Overview

In this project, I developed an image classifier using deep learning techniques, specifically with PyTorch. The project was divided into two parts:

### Part 1: Development
In the first part, I worked through a Jupyter notebook to implement the image classifier. While I received some guidance, the majority of the code was left up to me. The notebook serves as a crucial component of the project submission and demonstrates my ability to implement deep learning models.

### Part 2: Command Line App
The second part involved converting the trained image classifier into a command-line application that others can use. I created two Python scripts: `train.py` and `predict.py`. `train.py` trains a new network on a dataset and saves the model as a checkpoint, while `predict.py` uses the trained network to predict the class for an input image. I ensured that the application is user-friendly and versatile, allowing for different options such as choosing architectures, setting hyperparameters, and utilizing GPUs for training and inference.

## Key Features
- Utilized PyTorch for implementing the image classifier.
- Developed a command-line application for training and predicting with the classifier.
- Implemented various options for customization, including choosing architectures, setting hyperparameters, and using GPUs.

## Next Steps
Moving forward, I plan to further optimize the performance of the image classifier and explore additional functionalities to enhance its usability and effectiveness. I also aim to contribute to the open-source community by sharing my code and collaborating with other developers on similar projects.

## Conclusion
This project has provided me with valuable hands-on experience in deep learning and model development. It has strengthened my Python programming skills and equipped me with the knowledge and confidence to tackle complex machine learning tasks. I am proud of the outcomes achieved and excited about the future possibilities in this field.
